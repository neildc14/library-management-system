i have learned all about how to build a create form for a genre combining with the express-validator to validate and sanitize the data it gathered from the form the maintain a secured server.

to use the express-validator in the code,
var {body, validationResult}

however, i did not use the validationResult. instead, i implemented the error handling in front end to filter out the new genre if it has already been declared.
